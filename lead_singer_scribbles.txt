Tuesday shows are CURSED. I'm absolutely certain of this. Every Tuesday 
something goes wrong. The amps exploded in Munich (Tuesday). The drummer 
got food poisoning in Prague (also Tuesday). My voice cracked in Barcelona 
(you guessed it). I've started refusing Tuesday bookings. Track this in 
the data - I bet Tuesdays have the lowest energy scores across ALL venues.

The monks at one of the venues... or was it the goths? Someone has a noise 
limit. Brother Thomas - the old one with the massive beard - he WINCES at 
a certain volume. Once he winces, it's over. The energy just dies. But 
here's what's weird: I've ALSO seen him tolerate absolute chaos when the 
place was packed to the rafters. Maybe he just gives up enforcing when 
there's too many people? Or maybe he's deaf in one ear and it depends 
which way he's facing? Or maybe I'm thinking of a completely different 
venue. The tours blur together, man.

Speaking of the goths - they ONLY come alive at night. Or wait, is that 
obvious? Every venue is better at night, right? Actually no, I remember 
a killer afternoon show somewhere. Was it the mosh pit? The monastery? 
I genuinely don't remember.

FULL MOON = MAGIC 🌕

I am CONVINCED our best shows happen during full moons. The energy is 
just... different. Electric. The crowd moves like they're possessed. 
The drummer thinks I'm insane and says it's confirmation bias. But what 
does he know? He also thinks his lucky socks affect our performance.

Actually, speaking of socks - does outfit color matter? I wore red socks 
in Berlin and they went ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. Coincidence? In Amsterdam I 
wore the leather jacket and it was mid. But in Rotterdam the leather 
jacket killed. So maybe it's not about what we wear? Or maybe it is but 
it interacts with venue? The spandex always FEELS right but the data 
might say otherwise.

Also, I've been tracking the weather. Rain definitely sucks. But does it 
actually affect energy or does it just affect MY mood and I play worse? 
The outdoor venues (I think V_Delta is partly outdoor?) obviously suffer 
in storms. Or do they? Mosh pits in the rain are kind of legendary. 
Ugh, I don't know. Verify this.

PRICING STRATEGY NOTES (I think this was for the snobs? Or the mosh pit?)

$45 → they laughed at us. Actually booed. Threw a shoe.
$55 → mixed reactions, some dancing, some sneering
$62 → this felt like a sweet spot? Or was this a different venue?
$80 → definitely worked somewhere. Standing ovation. Or was that the 
      night we had the pyrotechnics malfunction and everyone thought
      it was part of the show?

The problem is I can't remember WHICH venue had the pricing sensitivity.
I want to say it was V_Gamma because they're snobs. But the mosh pit 
kids are broke, so maybe THEY'RE the price sensitive ones? Or maybe it's 
the monastery - monks probably care about value for money?

Also the accountant is USELESS. Half the entries are in pounds, some are 
in euros, some have dollar signs, and she logs comped tickets as "Free" 
which throws off all the averages. I once saw an entry for $500 which 
is definitely wrong - our max ticket price was like $100. And there's 
negative prices in there somehow? Fire her.

EXCHANGE RATES (I looked these up once):
£1 = $1.27 (approximately)
€1 = $1.09 (approximately)

Actually those might be outdated. Check a converter.

Things I'm CERTAIN about:
- [this section is blank]

Things I THINK are true:
- Volume matters. Somewhere. In some direction.
- Time of day matters. Probably.
- Price matters. To someone.
- Crowd size matters. Obviously? Or not?

Things the drummer insists are true (he's probably wrong):
- Moon phase is irrelevant (I disagree)
- Sock color is crucial (he's definitely wrong)
- The opener matters more than we think

Things that DEFINITELY DON'T matter:
- [this section is also blank]

Wait, does the opener actually matter? The snobs might care about the 
"full experience." But the mosh pit kids just want to rage - they 
probably don't even notice the opener. Or maybe they do? Our data guy 
tracks opener ratings (1-5 stars) so you can check this.

V_Delta is pure chaos. No rules. Just vibes.

...is what I used to think. But looking back at the tour logs, there 
IS a pattern. The packed shows were INSANE. The empty shows were dead. 
But isn't that true everywhere? Maybe V_Delta is special because the 
effect is stronger there. The mosh pit FEEDS on itself - more people 
means more energy which means more people go crazy which means more 
energy. It's exponential. Or linear. Or logarithmic. I don't know math.

Also I think louder is better at V_Delta? Unlike the monks who hate 
noise. Or wait - which venue was which? One venue loves loud, one 
hates it. Pretty sure. But I might be thinking of the same venue on 
different nights. Or different venues on the same night. We did a lot 
of double-headers.

IMPORTANT: Some of our data is absolute GARBAGE. I've seen:
- Ticket prices of $0 and $500 in the same column
- Energy scores of 999 (our scale goes to 100)
- Crowd counts of 50,000 (the biggest venue holds 1,000)
- Negative values for things that can't be negative

The data entry guy was clearly either drunk or running a crypto scam 
on the side. Clean this up before you do ANYTHING.

NOTE FROM RICK (THE MANAGER) - transcribed by me because I lost the original:

"J - 

Stop writing on napkins and hire a real analyst. I need to know the 
OPTIMAL TICKET PRICE for each venue. Not your 'vibes' - actual numbers.

Here's what I know about our costs:
- We pay about $5,000 per show (venue, crew, equipment)
- Plus something like $8 per person who shows up (security, cleaning, 
  insurance, rider costs, whatever)
- Venue capacity is around 800 for most places

The problem is: higher prices might mean fewer tickets sold. But also 
I've noticed when the crowd energy is low, people leave early and don't 
buy drinks or merch. So energy matters for revenue somehow.

I don't know the formula. YOU figure it out. That's why we pay 
consultants. Make me a graph or something.

- Rick

P.S. If you tell me 'it depends on the moon' I'm docking your pay."

Random observations (reliability: low)

→ The velvet outfits are NEW. We just started wearing them last month. 
  Might not even be in the historical data yet. They feel lucky though.

→ Weekends are better. I think. At all venues? Or just some?

→ The merch guy, Eddie, tracks post-show sales obsessively. Says there's 
  a correlation with energy. High energy = high sales. Obvious, right? 
  But I don't see how knowing what merch sold AFTER the show helps you 
  PREDICT energy BEFORE the show. He's a nice guy but not a data scientist.

→ I keep a log of Volume_Level on my amp. Goes from 1-11 (Spinal Tap 
  reference, obviously). But sometimes the readings glitch out. When we 
  push it too hard at certain venues, the sensor just shows NaN or 
  zeros out. Something about power feedback? The sound guy tried to 
  explain but I wasn't listening.

→ Different venues have OPPOSITE reactions to the same thing. What 
  works at one place bombs at another. Maybe train separate models? 
  Or one big model with venue as a feature? I don't know, I'm a singer.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONTRADICTIONS I NEED TO RESOLVE:

1. "Volume matters" vs "Crowd size matters more"
   → Maybe both? Maybe it depends on venue?

2. "Weekends are always better" vs "That Tuesday in London was fire"
   → Are weekends USUALLY better or ALWAYS better?

3. "Price sensitivity is at V_Gamma" vs "I remember a pricing thing at V_Delta"
   → Who actually cares about price? Everyone? Just snobs?

4. "Timing matters for goths" vs "Every venue has timing preferences"
   → Is V_Beta special or am I generalizing?

5. "Moon phase is real" vs "The drummer says I'm crazy"
   → VERIFY THIS. Prove him wrong.

6. "Weather affects energy" vs "Weather affects MY mood"
   → Control for my mood somehow? Oh wait, you can't. Never mind.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINAL NOTE - STUCK TO THE LAST PAGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To whoever is analyzing this data:

I know these notes are a mess. I wrote them over 6 months of touring 
while sleep-deprived, jet-lagged, and occasionally under the influence 
of various legal substances.

TRUST THE DATA, NOT ME. I'm probably wrong about half of this. Use my 
scribbles as HYPOTHESES TO TEST, not facts to assume. If the data says 
Tuesday is actually our best day, then I'm wrong about the curse. If 
moon phase has zero correlation, then the drummer was right (don't 
tell him).

The only things I'm confident about:
1. The data has quality issues. Clean it first.
2. Different venues behave differently. Don't treat them the same.
3. Some features in the dataset are useless noise. Figure out which.
4. Some features might be misleading. Think carefully about causation.

Good luck. Rock on. 🎸
